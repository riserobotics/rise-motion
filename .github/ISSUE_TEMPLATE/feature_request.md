## Context
_Whats the context of the problem feature being added? Why does this feature have to be added? What are the practical implications of this feature being added, and what are the problems that come up because it is not there? What part of the exoskeleton workflow will this feature improve?_

## Requirements
_What has to be added? Be specific! Dont just say 'We have to add a statemachine', instead say we need (1) a state machine with four states (2) The states should be a, b and c (3) The transition from a to b is defined by x, the one from a to c by y and the one from c to a by z. **Every bit of information that is required to solve thew issue has to be present or linked in the issue.**. Notes in here should be formatted as "- [ ] checkboxes. Each checkbox should describe one small step of solving the issue. Usage of graphs or diagrams is encouraged!"_

## Screenshots, Links, etc.
_If applicable, provide links, screenshots, diagrams or graphs here._

## Acceptance criteria
_Issues are reviewd by someone else than the developer working on them. What are the criterias for accepting the issue. Don't reiterate the requirements here, instead think of the consequences the new feature should have on the user and the main system. If a requirement is, for example, add a new service interface to some node, an acceptance criteria would be "A new node y can send requests of this format z to this adress and recieve this response in this timeframe. If acceptnace critereas can be put into automated testing, even better! Then tell which tests have to be run, and what they are testing."_

_Final issues should not contain the template instructions, just the headings. Also, don't include this line!_
